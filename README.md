### üß† Project 04: Data Structures & Algorithms Essentials

A collection of classic DSA problems solved in Python. This section proves foundational computer science knowledge and preparation for technical interviews. Each topic has a log file detailing the problems solved, the patterns used, and the complexity analysis.

- **Location:** `/04-dsa-essentials/`
- **Topics Covered:**
    - **Arrays & Hashing:** Solved problems like *Contains Duplicate*, *Valid Anagram*, and *Two Sum*, focusing on O(n) solutions with hash maps and sets.
    - **Two Pointers:** Solved problems like *Valid Palindrome* and *Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock*, focusing on O(1) space complexity solutions.
